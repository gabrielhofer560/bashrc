Some functions are defined to simply echo code to the terminal. 

I use these functions in competitive programming so that I can easily and 
efficiently write code to a file. 

For example, if I wanted to solve a new problem, I would enter the following
command to insert my CP template into the cpp file.

`$ temp > newfile.cpp`

Also, some simple aliases are defined for efficiency. Not much time is saved
with these but I still prefer to use them.
