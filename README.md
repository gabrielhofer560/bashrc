## bash functions

Some functions are defined to simply echo code to the terminal. 

I use these functions in competitive programming so that I can easily and 
efficiently write code to a file. 

For example, if I wanted to solve a new problem, I would enter the following
command to insert my CP template into the cpp file.

`$ temp > newfile.cpp`

## aliases

Also, some simple aliases are defined for efficiency. Not much time is saved
with these but I still prefer to use them. 

## usage for t

The following is an example of compiling file.cpp and running the executable
on 5 input files in1, in2, ..., in5.

`$ t file.cpp in in2 in3 in4 in5`
